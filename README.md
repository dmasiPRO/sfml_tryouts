This repository is a space where I conduct experiments with the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) in C++. Here, you'll find code snippets, test projects, and various experiments aimed at learning and utilizing SFML's capabilities for game development and graphical applications. Welcome to the world of creativity and exploration with SFML!
